[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This defines how applications can be deployed on a VSHN managed kubernetes Platform.
====

== Motivation

As described in xref:0003-management-layers.adoc[SDD 0003 - Management Layers] it is important to understand why we differentiate applications from Managed Services and why there are arbitrary ways how workloads or applications come onto a kubernetes cluster.

== Goals

Make it clear the SYN does not actually care about how applications come onto a managed platform.

== Non-Goals

Define how in details you can deploy an application or custom service

== Design Proposal

Applications are deployed in several ways on a cluster

* CI/CD pipeline managed by us or by the customer on its own (Kustomize, Helm, etc.)
* Customer / project specific GitOps repository
* Manually (kubectl, Rancher / OpenShift UI, etc.)

== Defining Services

An application deployment can create Service Objects in the Kubernetes API to provision needed backend services (DB, cache, etc.), see above.

* Such services are then automatically added to the "SYN Application Monitoring"
* The deployment can create special objects to add the applications health / metrics endpoint to the "SYN Application Monitoring"
* Via additional objects things like Backup, Maintenance, etc. can be controlled (question)

This automation is achieved with the help of Crossplane Services, see SDD#2019-10-18 - Crossplane Service Provisioning

= Style guide

The Jsonnet related parts of this guide build on top of https://github.com/databricks/jsonnet-style-guide/blob/30d4d54444c1001ba9561afd7c8de405630a2ca7/README.md[Jsonnet Guide] by https://databricks.com/[Databricks].

== General style

* Encode text files with UTF-8.
* End lines with a single `\n` (lf).
* Always end a file with a single `\n`.
  This doesn't apply to empty files (for example `.gitkeep`).
* Use two spaces for indentation except for `Makefile` where a single tab is to be used.
* Trim whitespace from the end of a line.

[NOTE]
====
Repositories of Project Syn provide an https://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig].
When using a https://editorconfig.org/#download[supported editor], space types and number of spaces will automatically be done correctly.
====

== Asciidoc style

* Don't split sentences across lines but keep them on one single line.
* Start a new line for each and every sentence.
* Follow the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/[Microsoft Writing Style Guide].

[NOTE]
====
The Microsoft Writing Style is being enforced with https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[Vale].
The implementation used can be found at https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft[errata-ai/Microsoft].
====

== Jsonnet style

== Syntactic style

=== Auto formatting

Use `jsonnetfmt` with the `--pad-arrays` option to format files.
This will fix basic style errors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Jsonnet is available in two implementations (https://github.com/google/jsonnet[jsonnet] and https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet[go-jsonnet]).
Within the automated builds, we use the https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jsonnet[Jsonnet docker image by Bitnami].
Should there be any discrepancies between versions and flavours, the one packaged by Bitnami is the reference.
====

=== Variable declaration

* Variables should be named in `camelCase` style, and should have self-explanatory names.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local serverPort = 1000;
local clientPort = 2000;
----

* Prefer `local` to `::` syntax for private/local variables.
  Unlike `::`, variables defined with `local` can't be overridden by children, nor accessed by other files.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
{
  // CORRECT
  local myVariable = 3,
  result: myVariable + 1,

  // INCORRECT
  myVariable:: 3,
  result: $.myVariable + 1,
}
----

=== Line length

* Limit lines to 120 characters.
* The only exceptions are import statements and URLs (although even for those, try to keep them under 120 chars).

=== Spacing and indentation

* Put one space before and after operators.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local c = a + b;
----

* Put one space after commas.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
[ "a", "b", "c" ] // CORRECT

["a","b","c"] // INCORRECT
----

* Put one space after colons.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
{
  // CORRECT
  foo:: "bar",
  baz: "taz",
  { hello: "world" },

  // INCORRECT
  foo :: "bar",
  baz:"taz",
  { hello : "world" },
}
----

* Put one space or line break after `{` and before `}`.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
local foo = { hello: "world" };
local bar =
  {
    hello: "world",
  };

// INCORRECT
local baz = {hello: "world"};
----

* Put one space or line break after `[` and before `]`.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
local foo = [ "a", "b" ] ;
local bar =
  [
    "a",
    "b",
  ];

// INCORRECT
local baz = ["a", "b"];
----

* Omit tailing `,` on single line arrays and objects.
  Keep them when splitting over multiple lines.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
local a = [ "a", "b" ] ;
local b = { hello: "world" };
local c =
  [
    "a",
    "b",
  ];
local d =
  {
    hello: "world",
  };

// INCORRECT
local e = [ "a", "b", ];
local f = { hello: "world", };
----

* Use 2-space indentation in general.

* Only function parameter declarations use 4-space indentation, to visually differentiate parameters from function body.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
local multiply(
    number1,
    number2) =
  {
    result: number1 * number 2
  }
----

* Omit vertical alignment.
  They draw attention to the wrong parts of the code and result in hard to review pull requests due to the white space changes.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// Don't align vertically
local plus     = "+";
local minus    = "-";
local multiply = "*";

// Do the following
local plus = "+";
local minus = "-";
local multiply = "*";
----

=== Blank lines (vertical whitespace)

* A single blank line appears:
** Within functions bodies, as needed to create logical groupings of statements.
** Optionally before the first member or after the last member of a template or function.
* Use one or two blank line(s) to separate logical blocks in files.
  Those blocks can be single function definitions or groups of local variables that semantically belong together.
* Excessive number of blank lines is discouraged.

=== Defining and using abstractions

==== Defining templates

* Rather than defining a concrete JSON object, it's often useful to define a template which takes some set of parameters before being materialized into JSON.
+
[INFO]
====
Looking at this from the perspective of object oriented programming, this looks like a class.
However it differs from classes, as the resulting objects don't have methods.
From the Jsonnet perspective, this is just a regular function.
When specifically referring to this type of function, use the term _template function_.
====
* When defining a template function, use the following syntax:
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local newAnimal(name, age) =
  {
    name: name,
    age: age,
  };

{
  newAnimal: newAnimal,
}
----

* When writing libraries, always return a single object encapsulating any functions instead of returning a single function.
  This allows returning multiple values (constants and functions) from a single library.
  Additionally this ensures libraries remain extensible without having to refactor all consumers.
* When defining a template function with both required and optional parameters, put required parameters first.
  Optional parameters should have a default, or `null` if a sentinel value is needed.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local newAnimal(name, age, isCat = true) = { ... }
----

* Wrap parameter declarations by putting one parameter per line with 2 extra spaces of indentation, to differentiate from the function body.
  Doing this is always acceptable, even if the definition would not wrap.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local newAnimal(
    name,
    age,
    isCat = true) = {
  name: name,
  …
}
----

== Defining functions

* Don't define functions within objects.
  Such objects will fail to render.
  The exception to this rule is the last object within a library file.
* Functions which return single values (rather than an object) should use parentheses `()` to enclose their bodies if they're multi-line, identically to how braces would be used.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
{
  multiply(number1, number2):
    (
      number1 * number 2
    ),
}
----

=== Using libraries

* Import all dependencies at the top of the file and given them names related to the imported file itself.
  This makes it easy to see what other files you depend on as the file grows.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
local animal = import "animal.libsonnet";
animal.newAnimal("Finnegan", 3);

// AVOID
(import "animal.libsonnet").newAnimal("Finnegan, 3);
----

* Keep function parameters on a single line or put one parameter per line when calling functions.
* When putting one parameter per line for a function call, add a line break (`\n`) after the opening `(`.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
// CORRECT
animal.newAnimal("Finnegan", 3);
animal.newAnimal(
  name = "Finnegan",
  age = 3,
);
animal.newAnimal(
  "Finnegan",
  3,
);

// INCORRECT
animal.newAnimal("Finnegan",
  3,
  42,
);
----

=== File structure

* Jsonnet files which can be materialized with no further inputs should end with the `.jsonnet` suffix.
* Jsonnet files which require parameters to be materialized or which are libraries should end with the `.libjsonnet` suffix.
* Files in `lib` always are libraries which should never be materialized and must be named accordingly.
  Those files are considered part of a public API.
  Treat functions in libraries accordingly and look out for breaking changes.

==== Documentation style

* Use `//` for inline comments.
* Use https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html[Docblocks] to document functions.
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
/**
 * Multicellular, eukaryotic organism of the kingdom Animalia
 *
 * @param name Name by which this animal may be called.
 * @param age Number of years (rounded to nearest int) animal has been alive.
 * @returns an object describing the animal.
 */
local Animal(name, age) = { … }
----

* Always put documentation at the top of each Jsonnet file or library to indicate its purpose.
* Exceptions can be made for `app.jsonnet` and `main.jsonnet`.

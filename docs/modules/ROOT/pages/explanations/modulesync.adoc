= Keep component boilerplate in sync

[abstract]
The creation of a new Commodore component yield several boilerplate files.
Some of those files are meant to be altered by a component author.
Others should be equal throughout all components managed by Project Syn.
As with all code, things will change.
As a result, components will drift apart over time.
To battle this issue, we make use of https://github.com/voxpupuli/modulesync[ModuleSync] to keep that boilerplate in sync.
The template repository for Project Syn is located at https://github.com/projectsyn/modulesync-control[modulesync-control].

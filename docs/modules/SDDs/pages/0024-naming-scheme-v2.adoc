[NOTE]
.Summary
====
Naming is hard, this page helps to make it easy. It describes the rules to name Project Syn tools.
====

== Motivation

In xref:0002-naming-scheme.adoc[SDD 0002 - Naming Scheme] a naming scheme was defined for Project Syn tools which turned out to be sub-optimal.
Having tools with non-descriptive names increases the (already relatively high) barrier of entry into the world of Project Syn.
This SDD describes a more descriptive naming scheme which solves this issue.

=== Goals

* Naming scheme which is descriptive
* Applicable to all new tools from now on

=== Non-Goals

* Renaming of existing tools (like Lieutenant, Steward and Commodore) as they will change over time anyways, ultimately being replaced by newer tools.

== Design Proposal

=== Display Names

Tools must have descriptive display names of the form `Syn ${purpose} ${type}`.

`$purpose` (Optional):: Describes purpose of the tool.

`$type`:: Describes the kind of the tool.
+
Examples:

* Operator
* Agent
* CLI
* Compiler

Examples:

* "Syn Catalog Compiler"
* "Syn Tenant Operator"
* "Syn Agent"
* *Syn CLI"

=== Binary Name

A tool's binary must be discoverable with `syn<Tab><Tab>`, and the suffix well known as a particular type of tool.

Examples:

* The Syn Catalog Compiler could have the binary name `syncc`, because nobody wants to type `syn-catalog-compiler`, and `cc` is well known as indicating a compiler (technically `cc` is the suffix indicating a C compiler, but luckily catalog also starts with a c).
* The Syn CLI could have the binary name `synctl` to match `kubectl`. `kubectl` should be immediately familiar to all users of Project Syn, so it would be nice if the Project Syn CLI would have a matching binary name.

== Drawbacks

=== Name tied to functionality

Descriptive names will tie functionality of the tooling to the name.
Allthough this isn't a drawback at first sight, it might become a drawback after some time as the tool advances and the functionality changes.
The tool would then need to be renamed which might impose a lot of work or a new tool with a new name would need to be created.
It's not always easy to detect that the purpose of a tool has changed but might become obvious as the project proceeds and new knowledge is gained.

=== Functionality hard to describe

It's not always easy to describe the functionality in one single word and from time to time this will make it hard to find a matching name.

== Alternatives

Use non-descriptive and fictive names, which would impose that this SDD won't go into effect.

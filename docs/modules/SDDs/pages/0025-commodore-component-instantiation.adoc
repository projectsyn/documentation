.Summary
====
This SDD describes possible options to allow Commodore components to be instantiated multiple times per cluster.
It additionally defines the option we've chosen to implement.
====

== Motivation

Currently Commodore components don't support installing multiple instances of the software they manage.
There are already some components for which installing multiple instances is a common use case, such as the https://github.com/projectsyn/component-nfs-client-provisioner/[nfs-client-provisioner component].

=== Goals

* Define how we want to allow Commodore components to be instantiated multiple times per cluster.

=== Non-Goals

* Define a solution for managing multiple instances of services for the customer on a Syn-enabled cluster.

== Design Proposal

Commodore will provide a well-defined structure for instantiating components and providing per-instance parameters.
Commodore will provide the instance's identifier ("name") to the component in a well-defined way.
Component authors must explicitly declare that their component supports instantiation.
Similar to Helm charts, the components themselves must make sure to not cause any naming collisions of objects.
This is required both for namespaced and non-namespaced resources.
Commodore won't modify the `parameters.<component-name>.namespace` field for instantiated components.
Component authors need to explicitly implement a namespace per instance, if they so desire.

Rather than requiring users to manually implement "common" parameters, Commodore will transparently merge instance and "common" parameters by merging the instance parameters into `parameters.<component-name>` in each Kapitan target.

The astute reader will notice that the proposed design combines features from both "pure" approaches listed in <<Alternatives>>.

=== User Stories

* As a user, I would like to configure multiple instances of `nfs-client-provisioner` which provision volumes on different NFS shares on my Project Syn-managed clusters.
  Ideally, I would like to be able to provide shared configuration options, such as mount options only once.

=== Implementation Notes

We could implement component instantiation using aliasing.
The aliasing would be expressed by the keyword "as" in the entries in `applications`.
If an instance-aware component is added without an alias, its regular name would be used as the instance name.
For the aliased instances, users can provide overrides in `parameters.<alias>`, with dashes in the alias name replaced by underscores.

Taking `nfs-client-provisioner` as the example, this could look somewhat as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
applications:
  - nfs-client-provisioner
  - nfs-client-provisioner as nfs-fast
  - nfs-client-provisioner as nfs-slow

parameters:
  nfs_client_provisioner:
    host: nfs.example.com # shared between all instances
    path: /nfs # used for the unaliased instance
  nfs_fast:
    path: /path/to/fast/share # used for alias nfs_fast
  nfs_slow:
    path: /path/to/slow/share # used for alias nfs_slow
----

For the alias approach, Commodore can generate customized targets for each alias.
Taking the `nfs-fast` alias as an example the target would look as follows.

.inventory/targets/nfs-fast.yml
[source,yaml]
----
classes:
  - [ ... default classes ... ]
  - global.commodore
  - components.nfs-client-provisioner
parameters:
  kapitan:
    vars:
      target: nfs-fast
    nfs_client_provisioner: ${nfs_fast}
----


== Alternatives

=== Multi-instance aware components

One alternative approach for supporting instantiating components, is to simply leave implementation to the component authors.
A pure form of this approach needs no changes in Commodore, but has some significant drawbacks from a usability perspective.
For this approach, component authors need to implement multi-instance support in each component individually.

This approach works well for infrastructure tooling for which a Kubernetes operator exists.
If an operator exists, the component can install the operator and associated CRDs, and can render instances as custom resources for the operator to provision.

The main drawback of the pure approach is that it may not be feasible to implement without some changes in Commodore for components which use Helm charts as their base, unless the Helm chart exposes a similar structure.
The reason for this is that Kapitan's Helm templating is expressed in the reclass inventory, and reclass isn't flexible enough to instantiate multiple copies of a part of the hierarchy based on another key in the inventory.

While it's ultimately left to the component authors, we assume that many components will expose the multi-instance nature of the component in `parameters.<component-name>`.
Taking `nfs-client-provisioner` as our working example, the parameters structure might look roughly as reproduced below.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  nfs_client_provisioner:
    namespace: ...
    common:
      host: ...
    instances:
      instanceA:
        path: ...
      instanceB:
        path: ...
      instanceC:
        host: ...
        path: ...
----

In this example structure, the component allows users to define configurations which are shared between multiple (but maybe not all) instances in a key `common`.
Instances are configured in key `instances`, and keys in `instances` are used as instance identifiers.
This hypothetical multi-instance-aware nfs-client-provisioner component includes internal logic which allows users to only specify overrides for instances and fills in missing keys with their counterparts defined in `common`.

=== Commodore support for component instantiation

The other alternative approach is to not make components multi-instance aware, but instead implement support for instantiating a component multiple times in Commodore.
The pure form of this approach would make all components support multiple instances without any changes to the component.
This would potentially scale better, as component authors won't have to reinvent the wheel for every component that needs multi-instance support.

However, a pure form of this approach has different problems, as Commodore may need to extensively rewrite component implementations to ensure that creating multiple instances of a component doesn't result in identifier conflicts.

For this approach, Commodore will expect an identical structure in `parameters` for each component instance .
Users wishing to instantiate a component multiple times need to adhere to Commodore's expected structure and provide a full set of parameters for each instance.
Users are free to use reclass references to share common parameter values between instances.

[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This is the concept on how we manage a Kubernetes cluster after it's up an running.
====

== Motivation

Most providers and Kubernetes cluster management frameworks and concepts
end when the cluster is up and running. To achieve feature parity with
the VMSFv1 (Puppet manged world) we need to do more.

We want to have one source of truth when configuring all aspects of a
VSHN
https://wiki.vshn.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151914954[Managed
Platform].

=== Goals

* Manage (provisioned and configured) all things needed to be a SYN
Managed Platform, e.g.:
** The SYN management framework (Steward, flux)
** The Monitoring framework
** Backup framework
** Crossplane CRDs and Operators
** Managed Services (Postgres, MySQL, Redis, ...) operators, when
running on a Cloud which doesn't provide such services
** cert-manager
** Vault
** ... image:test_files/help_16.svg[(question)]
* Have cross customer and cluster sane defaults for all the configured
services, while still having a easy way to overwrite per provider,
distribution, cluster, customer, project, etc.
* Versioning of the components / services and straight forward selection
of which version is used where

=== Non-Goals

* Provisioning the Kubernetes cluster (e.g. launching an EKS cluster or
spinning up VMs and installing Kubernetes)
* Maintenance (Upgrades) of the Kubernetes cluster itself

== Design Proposal

=== Terminology

* *Output Repo* is where the generated Kubernetes manifests and Kapitan
secret files are stored, ready to be used by GitOps on the target
cluster
* *Input Repo* is where cluster / customer specific overrides can be
committed to
* *Config Repo* is where the global configuration is stored
* *Target Cluster* is the Kubernetes cluster that is managed
* https://wiki.vshn.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151915099[*Commodore*]
A tool built around Kapitan which uses a Puppet Hiera like approach to
fetch configuration and _components_ from different source (_Input
Repo,_
https://wiki.vshn.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151914981[SYNventory],
_Config repos_) to render jsonnet templates to produce the Kubernetes
manifests, the _Catalog_.
* *Components* are repos containing bundles of Kapitan classes and
templates which define how a piece of software is configured and
deployed
* *Catalog* The kubernetes manifests that are produced by _TheMagic_ and
commited to the _Output Repo._

=== Concept Overview

* Generated config (Kubernetes manifests) in a per-cluster _Output_ git
repository.
* This git repository is then used for GitOps on the actual cluster.
GitOps enforces the state independently of whether new config is
generated or not (no SPOF).
* [line-through]*This will most likely also generate the configuration
to initially provision the cluster using things like Rancher, Terraform,
Crossplane Cluster, etc.*
** The provisioning of the Cluster is out-of-scope for the Platform
Configuration management. A design for generating initial config for
provisioning will be described in another SDD.

=== Commodore

Commodore collects all the required configuration (from the SYNventory
API and the Input and Config repo) and constructs a
https://kapitan.dev/inventory/[Kapitan inventory] which is uses to
produce the cluster catalog. Commodore is defined in its own SDD:

==== Kapitan class hierarchy

image::pcm_class_hierarchy.png[]

Commodore produces a Kapitan target (a target is the part of the Kapitan
inventory which defines a unit for which configuration should be
rendered) for the _target cluster_ named `cluster` which includes the
classes `global.common`, `global.<kubernetes-distribution>`,
`global.<cloud-provider>` and `<customer-name>.<cluster-name>` . The
class hierarchy is defined by the order the classes are included in the
target. The current hierarchy is (weakest to strongest):

* `defaults.*`
* `global.common`
* `global.<kubernetes-distribution>` 
* `global.<cloud-provider>` 
* `global.<cloud-provider>.<region>`
* `<customer-name>.<cluster-name>`

Components provide two classes: one which defines how the component's
templates should be rendered (symlinked to `components.<component-name`)
and one which defines default parameters for the component (symlinked to
`defaults.<component-name>`). All available default parameters classes
are included before any configuration classes. This allows users to
include components at any level in the configuration hierarchy without
having to worry about a component's defaults overriding customization
which is applied earlier in the hierarchy. Component classes can always
access all the configuration, even values that are only defined at a
stronger hierarchy level. The `defaults.*`  notation in the list above
is a short-hand notation for the mechanism in Commodore which includes
each component's defaults class explicitly.

The current hierarchy places the Kubernetes distribution before the
cloud-provider in the configuration hierarchy. This allows selecting
which components are included for each Kubernetes distribution which is
supported by Commodore. F.e. this hierarchy allows to selectively
include only components which have been tested when bootstrapping the
configurations for a new Kubernetes distribution.

Operators are free to include additional classes at each of the
`global.*`  hierarchy levels, f.e. an operator may choose to not have
one large `global.common`  class but rather split up the fleet-wide
defaults into smaller classes which are included in `global.common` , as
indicated on the diagram below. The same structure can be applied at the
cloud provider level, where the target only includes
`<cloud-provider>.<region>`, but operators are free to keep cloud-wide
defaults in one or more classes which are included by each cloud region
class.

The customer level of the hierarchy, which is included via
class `<customer>.<cluster>` and stored in a separate repository, can
have any structure. The only requirement is that a `<cluster>.yml`  file
exists in the repository for each SYN-managed cluster of the customer.
This `<cluster>.yml`  file can itself include further classes (yaml
files) which are defined in the customer repository by including the
class as `<customer>.<filename>`. For example, a customer could have a
`common.yml`  which defines their fleet-wide defaults. Each
`<cluster>.yml`  can then include the customer defaults
as `<customer>.common` .

==== Job runner

*Speculative*

The Commodore job runner is responsible for running Commodore for an
output repo if any of the inputs change (input repo, config repo,
components). The job runner implementation is open to change, an early
proposal was to run the Commodore jobs as CI jobs on the output repo.
Commodore does include a Dockerfile which can be used to build a
Commodore docker image.

=== Input Repo

The input repo can be hosted on VSHN infrastructure or customer
infrastructure. It contains Kapitan class definitions. The classes are
available to Commodore/Kapitan as <`customer-name>.<class-name>` .
Commodore expects that for each cluster a class
<`customer-name>.<cluster-name`>  exists in the input repo.

=== Config Repo

The config repo is hosted on VSHN infrastructure and contains Kapitan
class definitions. The classes are available to Commodore/Kapitan as
`global.class-name` . Commodore expects that classes `global.common` ,
`global.<cloud-provider>`  and `global.<kubernetes-distribution`> to
exist.

=== Components

Commodore components are hosted in Git repos on VSHN infrastrucutre and
contain Kapitan templates (also "https://kapitan.dev/compile/[Kapitan
components]") and Kapitan classes. Each component class is made
available to Kapitan as `components.<component-name>` . Commodore
fetches components from Git and ensures that the contained Kapitan
classes are available to Kapitan. Commodore components can also define
"postprocessing" steps which are applied to the Kapitan output to create
the final _catalog_. Components can utilize most of Kapitan's features
including Kapitan's https://kapitan.dev/external_dependencies/[external
dependencies] and https://kapitan.dev/secrets/[secret references].

==== Secret references

Commodore is opinionated in how it supports Kapitan's secret references:
Only references to secrets in Vault (in the KV v2 backend) are
supported, and Commodore uses the path to the Kapitan secret file in the
reference to determine the name and key in the corresponding Vault
secret. References to secrets must always be made in the configuration
and never in Kapitan templates directly. This restriction allows
Commodore to scan the configuration and create Kapitan secret files for
all the references it finds. Secret files are committed to the _output
repo_ together with the _catalog_.

=== Risks and Mitigations

* *RISK*: The design currently depends on the VSHN Git infrastructure +
*MITIGATION:* the dependency on the VSHN Git infrastructure can be
softened by having the input, config and component repos replicated on
multiple Git hosting platforms'
* *RISK*: The commodore job runner may depend on an existing GitLab CI
infrastructure
* *MITIGATION*: It should be possible to migrate the jobs onto other job
runner infrastructures (e.g. Tekton
https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline[pipelines] and
https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers[triggers]).

== Drawbacks

The heart of the platform configuration management is an external
dependency, Kapitan, which has the drawback that fixing problems in
Kapian may be more complicated than in a piece of software that is
maintained by VSHN. Because Kapitan is implemented in Python, the
decision was made to implement Commodore itself in Python as well. This
has the drawback that Python is not particularly containerization
friendly. The commodore Docker image is roughly 430MB in size.

.Summary
====
This SDD has been obsoleted by xref:0024-naming-scheme-v2.adoc[SDD 0024 - Project Syn Tools Naming Scheme v2]
====

== Motivation

It safes a lot of time by providing a guideline for names. Also it ensures a certain structure and consistency.

== Goals

Name all components of SYN in a consistent and structured way.

== Non-Goals

Being a hard rule. It's only a guideline and there can be exceptions in certain cases.

== Design Proposal

=== Tool naming

* Names should follow the navy ranks, as specified in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy_ranks,_rates,_and_uniforms_of_the_18th_and_19th_centuries[Wikipedia].
* Where the name isn't such a navy rank the word "SYN" should be included in the name (for example SYNventory, SYNsights, etc.) if possible.

=== Commodore Component Names

* The name should be independent from the tool(s) it manages, for example synsights-metrics instead of prometheus, or backup instead of k8up

=== Git repository naming and location

| Type             | Scheme
| Tool             | https://github.com/projectsyn/<toolname>
| Component        | https://github.com/projectsyn/component-<componentname>
| Inventories      | https://git.example.com/syn/customers/<customername>
| Cluster catalogs | https://git.example.com/syn/cluster-catalogs/<clustername>
|===

=== Kubernetes namespace naming

The convention is: syn-<name>

=== Kubernetes object naming

When the object already is in a Syn named namespace it doesn't need to contain Syn again, so f.e. instead of synbackup it's enough to name it backup.

=== Configuration parameters

tbd (naming scheme for configuration parameters of component variables)

=== Configuration hierarchy

tbd

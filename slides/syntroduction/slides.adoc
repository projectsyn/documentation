Welcome to Project Syn!
--

== Remember Virtual Machines?

* Automated provisioning
* Many Virtual Machines
* Configuration Management!

[.notes]
--
* VMs automatically deployed, still empty, no apps, no config
* Want to configure them by hand? NO!
* Solution: Configuration Management Tool like Puppet
* Install agent, register at server, wait and profit
* Configuration drift? No, enforced by agent in VM
* Multiple infrastructures and Linux distros? Abstracted by cfgmgmt tool
* All defined as code
--

== Remember Kubernetes Clusters?

* Automated provisioning
* Many Kubernetes Cluster
* Configuration Management?

[.notes]
--
There was a time of just having one or two clusters, carefully hand-crafted.

* Kubernetes cluster automatically deployed, still empty, no apps, no config
* Want to configure them by hand? NO!
* Solution: ?
* What if you could just register the cluster, deploy an agent, wait and profit?
* Smells like configuration management - just like if the cluster was "just a VM"

And this brings us to Project Syn
--

== Project Syn

> Project Syn is a set of tools helping to securely manage a fleet of Kubernetes clusters. It brings a hierarchical configuration management based on GitOps principles, reusable components and an inventory of information about all Kubernetes clusters.

[.notes]
--
* It's not just one single tool and doesn't want to reinvent the wheel.
* Re-using of already existing tools, glueing them together.
* Bringing ideas upstream wherever possible and where it makes sense.
* Re-usability is key!
--

== Comparison to the Known

Let's compare Project Syn to Puppet:

* Puppet Server → *Commodore*: Catalog compilation
* PuppetDB → *Lieutenant*: Inventory and facts
* Puppet Agent → *Steward* and Argo CD: In-cluster agent
* Hiera → Kapitan Reclass: Hierarchical configuration structure
* Puppet Module → Commodore Component

[.notes]
--
* Puppet gave a lot of ideas how the architecture will look like
* Other configuration management tools may be similar
--

== Third-party Tooling

On the shoulders of giants:

* https://kapitan.dev[Kapitan]
* https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd[Argo CD]
* https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com[Renovate]
* https://www.vaultproject.io[HashiCorp Vault]
* https://about.gitlab.com[GitLab]

And more ...

[.notes]
--
Without these tools Project Syn wouldn't work as it does today:

* *Kapitan*: Core tool for generating configuration with hierarchical configuration lookup
* *Argo CD*: GitOps tooling, applying and enforcing configuration in-cluster
* *Renovate*: Keeping components and software versions up-to-date
* *Vault*: Storing secrets with tight integration in Kapitan
* *GitLab*: Git repository management

* Commodore is the main tool, generating configuration adapted and parametrized for a clusters
* The generated catalog is pushed to a Git repository per cluster
* Commodore get's all the information from Lieutenant and from input Git repositories
* Commodore components are the reusable parts to compose configuration
* Lieutenant stores Tenants and Clusters and manages Git repositories
* Steward bootstraps Argo CD into a cluster and configures it
* Steward generates an SSH deploy key and Lieutenant configures access on the Git repo
* Argo CD connects to the cluster Git catalog repository and retrieves the YAMLs
* Kapitan reveals secrets only on the cluster during apply, accessing the Vault
--

== Features Conclusion

* Configuration Management for Kubernetes
* Full GitOps Operations and Automation
* Reusable Configuration Management Components
* Secrets Management
* Multi-Cluster and Multi-Tenant Management (Inventory)

[.notes]
--
This is just a conclusion what Project Syn offers
--

== What's coming

Development is in full swing:

* Renaming of tools
* Automated catalog generation
* API replacement by plain Kubernetes API
* User experience improvements
* Syn CLI
* Component Hub

Roadmap: https://syn.tools/syn/about/roadmap.html

[.notes]
--
* Although Project Syn is used in production and in several projects, it's still in full development towards a 1.0 release.
* Roadmap is subject to change and has a lot more details.
* Planning happens all on GitHub with issues and projects there.
--

== Do It Yourself

Browse to
